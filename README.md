📞 Contact Management Web App

A full-stack Contact Management System built using Spring Boot, REST API, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This web application allows users to sign up, log in, manage their personal contact list, and maintain complete privacy through secure JWT Authentication and Spring Security.

Designed with a clean UI and smooth user flow, this project demonstrates real-world full-stack development using modern backend practices and interactive frontend functionalities.

🖥️ Overview

The Contact Management Web App is a complete CRUD-based full-stack project where users can securely manage their contacts.
Each user gets a private dashboard, where only their contacts are visible.

This project focuses on:
Secure authentication (JWT + Spring Security)
REST API design & backend logic
Real-time frontend interaction using JavaScript
Proper database design with MySQL
Full CRUD operations with validation
It mimics the core functionality of real products like Google Contacts — but simplified and fully custom-built.

✨ Key Features
✅ User Registration & Login

Users can sign up and log in securely. Authentication is handled using JWT tokens, stored safely on the client-side.

✅ Secure Authentication (JWT + Spring Security)
Protects API endpoints
Each user gets a unique token after login
Only authenticated users can access contact APIs

✅ Add New Contacts
Users can add contacts with details like:
Name
Phone number
Email
Gender

✅ Edit Existing Contacts
Update any contact details easily using intuitive UI forms.

✅ Delete Contacts
Remove any contact permanently with a single click.

✅ Search Contacts
Real-time search bar that filters contacts instantly based on name, email, or phone.

✅ Private Contact List
Each user can see only their own contacts.
Contacts of other users are completely hidden thanks to security filters.

🚫 (Pending Feature) Forgot & Reset Password
The only feature not yet implemented.
This will allow users to reset their password through an email-based workflow.
